All sophomores have had an ISMP mentor in their first year to guide them through academics, extra-curricular and personal life problems. But as they enter the second year of undergraduate studies, these students donâ€™t always get the right guidance from the department or hostel seniors as they used to get from our mentors and therefore Sophomore Mentoring is like an extension of the same ISMP program. This program is necessary to help students make a transition into the academics of the department, after having completed common first-year courses.

We have allotted mentors to each student from the department to ensure that every student gets the right guidance.
